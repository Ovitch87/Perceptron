# Perceptron

A basic implementation of a perceptron classifier, including application to the iris dataset.

## Contents

The Perceptron folder contains three Python files:

- **Perceptron_algorithm.py**: Contains the perceptron algorithm class, including helper functions.
  
- **iris_0_setosa.py**: Application of the perceptron algorithm to the iris dataset for the classification of setosa vs. non-setosa flower type.
  
- **iris_1_versicolor.py**: Application of the perceptron algorithm to the iris dataset for the classification of versicolor vs. non-versicolor flower type.
  
- **iris_2_virginica.py**: Application of the perceptron algorithm to the iris dataset for the classification of virginica vs. non-virginica flower type.

## Running the Code

To run the code, download the Perceptron folder to a directory of your choice. Execute any of the `iris_0_setosa.py`, `iris_1_versicolor.py`, or `iris_2_virginica.py` files using the terminal or your favorite editor.

Running the code will train the perceptron algorithm, and a 3D plot will be displayed of the datapoints and the found separation plane. A second plot will display the classification errors per iteration during training.

*In the case of `iris_1_versicolor.py`, you might want to run the code more than once to find the best separation plane.

## Dependencies

To run the code you will need the python sklearn, mathplotlib and numpy packages.
Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the code.
